| This ammonia gas detector can accurately detect gas/ammonia while also keeping track of the temperature (both C/F) and humidity. It has a tripod mount port so you can mount it and have it continually monitor things to get an accurate reading of change in the same spot. The case could be better, but it gets the job done and the detector works great.| 1. Accurate gas detection-Explicit 2. Stable and continuous monitoring via tripod mount-Explicit 3.

| This is a good gas detector. Seems to be working correctly. Not hard to use. Seems to give me good readings. The case is made out of a hard plastic and is wrapped with a shock absorber hard rubberized type material to protect it against drops. I still would take precautions against doing so. Seems to be well made. Does come with directions for use. I do like how the detector comes with a temperature and humidity screen. The only complaint I have about this is the case. I mean for a quality detector there should be a quality case to put it in. Come on now. For something of this value it should be finished off with a great case.

|The item was well packaged and first impressions right out of the box were positive - it has an actual owner's manual, felt durable, and had protective wrapping around everything. I had no issues connecting the sensor array to the console, and no issues using the "awnet" app to connect the console to the wifi router/internet (Ambient Weather Dashboard, Weather Underground, and PWS.com). Once that was all complete, I needed to mount the array outside. Now, I live in an urban area & in an apartment. After toiling around with where & how to situate the sensor array, I decided on what's indicated in the picture. While I find occasionally that the wind & solar measurements are curtailed due to nearby homes (which I knew before buying it), the temp and rain are always right in line with other nearby wx stations (including Davis ones). Plus, this setup is mobile, non-permanent, and easily accessible. Accuracy is hugely important to me. You can have a $500 station and have it report bad readings, so for 1 month after the array went "live", I recorded daily high & low temps of all nearby Weather Underground stations within 2 miles. Safe to say, my WS-2902a was right in line with all other stations - between 0-2°F difference, most times within 1°F. The rain, UV Index, Solar Radiation were also accurate, so much so that I stand by my WS-2902a's readings whenever I need to report to the NWS for storms. I was afraid that the temp sensor would be too warm in the sun and the warmth reflecting from my apartment building would get picked up from the temperature probe - I was wrong. The solar shield works fantastically! I doubt when summer comes with the heat & high sun angle that that will change. With all of its measurement sensors (temp w/ dew point & humidity, wind speed, wind direction, rainfall, UV, Solar, Pressure, and indoor temp-dew-humidity) combined with their accuracy, it’s an extremely well-priced unit. All my data can be viewed on Ambient Weather Dashboard online or in their app, and if you don't like that there's PWS.com and Weather Underground which record your data in 5 min intervals, but display live readings quicker than that. You can even export your data to excel to make graphs. Mobile access is wonderful. Also, I can't say enough about the CEO Ed Edelman. He is countlessly answering my questions - he's super fast to respond and gives you honest & direct answers (no BS like other companies). And he's quick to release update fixes to the station's firmware and AWDashboard when customers report issues. There's even a FB group for Ambient Weather device owners, which serves as an additional tool to receive input from other owners in the group. Best customer experience I think I've ever had, and I know others can say the same. Sure, there are small things about the WS-2902a that I've noted that could be improved, but nothing drastic. I'd like increased customization of the AWDashboard (manually moving tiles around, more computed data displayed like "Today's Max UV Reading"). I also wish the display cycled through other measurements (Dew Point, Wind Chill, Heat Index, Max Daily Gust), but you can view that online and/or you can buy the WS-2000 console for that and for better all-around viewing angles and you can even add up to 8 additional temp/humidity/dew point sensors.|1.

|I have a lot of fruit trees in my backyard plus a rose and lavender garden. Wanted to keep on top of local weather conditions so if needed I could protect my plantings from cold etc...I decided to go with Ambient Weather's WS-2902 D. It includes a temperature module, anemometer, wind direction, wind speed and rain gauge. The most time consuming part of installation was the mount itself. The instructions for mounting the weather station to the top of a mast are well described and a simple job of attaching the U Bolts with screws and using the bubble level (built in to the top of the unit) to keep the device level. You must make sure that the arrow embedded on top of the hard plastic of the unit is pointed exactly to the north. Double check that. I used a compass app on my phone. Worked great. I chose to mount my station on 1.5" PVC pipe. Yes, they recommend steel but go out and try to price that! Ridiculous. The weather station accepts 1.25-2 inch pipe. My 5 foot section was installed on a deck support with the help of an antenna mounting kit purchased on Amazon. Hard steel and strong U Bolts. That thing is screwed in for life. The only drawback with PVC is the wind. This can cause movement of the station affecting readings. I am a ham radio operator and used an identical 1/8" black rope (parachute like cord) that I have hanging a wire dipole between 2 trees on my property. For the weather station I made 3 guy rope supporting lengths that you can see in the picture. There are two in this picture. I put in the 3rd down at ground level a few days later. Now, there is no and I mean NO movement of the pole with high wind gusts. The height of the deck plus the pvc tubing puts the weather station at 18 feet above the ground. There are two caveats: Make your weather station accessible. You have to clean out the rain gauge apparatus every couple of months plus swap out batteries; so you do not want to kill yourself dangling off of a ladder. BTW, the unit is powered with a solar cell built into the top part of the station. Batteries are used when there is insufficient daylight. The weather station immediately connected with the base unit. I have the console sitting on my home office desk. Connecting the unit to wifi and weather underground, weather cloud and the Ambient site take time but well worth it in the end. I periodically check other units in my neck of the woods on the Ambient website. The console display is well laid out and easy to see all parameters. It is pretty intuitive trying to figure out what button does what but it is a good idea to read through all the instructions. The display also shows UV light, light, phases of the moon, indoor temp and humidity, outdoor temp and humidity, rain amounts, wind speed and direction, date, time. There are signal strength connecting bars (mine have a solid 5) that show the quality of the connection between the station outside and your console. These are located about half way across the top. There is your typical wifi connection strength indicator at the top right of the display. I am quite satisfied with the entire system. It does it all. The only thing  it doesn't do is pour me a nice glass of port at dinner time!|1. Sturdy mounting and stability-Explicit 2. Solar powered and battery backup-Explicit 3.

|I bought this one to replace an older Davis Vantage Pro2. The Davis station and its sensor are considerably heavier duty than this Ambient station. My reason for replacing the Davis was that the Davis could not connect to the 'net except through a computer running WeatherLink software -- all of which regularly crashed. Yes, I know there is a wireless device that can be installed inside the Davis that is supposed to send data wirelessly to a router then to the 'net -- I tried that, instructions were horrible, tech support of no help, sent it back for refund. This weather station went together in a few minutes, everything worked right out of the box. I downloaded the WeatherLink app to my iPhone and followed the instructions to detect and set up the wireless that is part of the weather station. After about 10 minutes of fiddling around with it, the station sensors -- 125 feet away on a 20-foot tall post -- are talking to the console; the console is talking to the 'net through my wireless router; and my station is reporting on both AmbientWeather and Wunderground|1.

|It comes in a million pieces - including extra pieces that apparently do go with the unit? A weird spring? (see pic) See UPDATE below in next item. It took a while, but I found out what it was. It's not in the huge manual. The instruction booklet is really awful and refers to items that don't go with this unit - NO instructions for extra pieces or even acknowledgment of them in the list of pieces (spring for example) UPDATE: Don't look for instructions - but I found info that it is poked into the center of the rain funnel to work as some sort of filter.. but it doesn't work. It just slows the rain from going down the funnel and doesn't stop any debris - at least not so far. So - stays in the CON pile. The instructions to connect the unit to wifi via your smartphone is HORRIBLE and doesn't work. If you're purchasing because it offers "wifi" buy something else. They don't provide an easy install QR or anything. It's just soooo much harder than it should be. Note: The flashing wifi symbol DOES stop flashing, contrary to what the "in the know" tech support expert" told me. The fact it stops flashing is good and should be in the PRO column, but it's not enough to turn the tide here. Now, if you are a professional tech support person who specializes in wifi connectivity, you MIGHT succeed - but I would not lay money on it. The app is completely useless - I live relatively rurally. So it would not register my address. Instead, I was given a choice to choose someone else's address(es) all more than 30 miles from me for weather checks. What??? Yeah, the app is junk.

|So, I purchased this for my father, who recently passed away. I decided to take it and set it up at my house because we used to love to chat about the weather. The "buttons'' are just bad, touch sensitive membrane keys. If you accidentally hit the set button, it will display the mac address of the unit. Now if you are a network engineer by trade (as I am) this is nice, but it is not at all clear how to get back to the normal display (hint it will revert after about 30 seconds or so) via the device itself. The WIFI setup is the stuff of nightmares. Being a network engineer, I have multiple iOS and Android devices. There are two different apps for setup, one for Wifi setup and another for looking at device data. Why this is a thing in 2023 is beyond me. The device does not support 5 Ghz WIFI which I could give them a pass on. I fiddled with both the Android version and IOS versions trying to get the WIFI to set up properly to no avail. the iOS app just flat-out crashed. Android does not crash but the setup dance (i.e. join local WIFI network, join device broadcasted network) is saddled with terrible UX/UI and flat out does not work. Looking at both the manual and online help guides, both have unclear steps, spelling mistakes, etc. With all the above I wanted to point out in the interests of fairness that you do not need to establish a WIFI connection to use the devices basic functionality. It’s used to link other services, upgrade firmware etc. It will read data from the sensor platform without setting up a WIFI connection. I wanted this review to exist because if you are buying this for someone less technically inclined stay away from it or you will be stuck with a device that does not allow its full functionality due to a bad software stack or worse, supporting people trying to get its wireless functionality to work (good luck).|1.

|When I received my weather station, I was all excited. Then reality hit when the only readings that were accurate were time, date and phase of the moon. Not a single weather reading was close to accurate. I've performed all the calibration steps, and have most things reasonably close. Except one. The Rain Gauge. Ambient calibration instructions require a minimum 4 inch wide calibrated rain gauge. I don't have one, and no luck finding one that a homeowner can afford for a one-time use. So I emailed Ambient tech support and explained the situation. I asked them for what one cup of water, poured into this model (WS-2902C) , how much rain would the display show. Ambient Tech Support responded "they do not have that info". Nothing else. Well, hmmm. OK. Since they are the manufacturer's Tech Spt, I assume they would have one of these stations set up and in use. So I replied back immediately and asked him if he would be so kind as to perform the experiment (just pour a cup into the rain collector) and let me know what the display reads. I also told him I'm just a homeowner, I'm not using this for some scientific study. This might be a great way to help customers in the future! Ambient Tech Spt (yes, I have the guy's actual name) replied he was too busy to help me at this time ! What ??? !!!. Incredible. So I waited a week (yes, I try to be patient), and sent another email. once again asking for help with the reading for 1 cup . .or any other measured amount of water. Instead I receive back an engineering formula. Last night I received an official reply from Ambient thru Amazon message service on the problem that basically tells me the same thing as the manual. .. use a calibrated rain gauge (minimum 4" wide) to get an accurate reading, and then calibrate the station. So I'm back to square 1. Folks, the weather station looks pretty, but honestly, go find one from a manufacturer that actually cares about supporting their product for everyday homeowner customers.|1.

|I had a Davis weather station for a couple years and then it broke. Calls to their technical support or no help. They were insisting that device was working properly, but it wasn't reporting any temperature. From there and they couldn't see any problem with it. After spending a lot of time trying to get it to work without success somehow I was lucky enough to come across information regarding Tempest. This device is so simple to install and configure. I can't imagine a better design. I called the technical support with one question actually before I brought the product and got someone to answer within two or three rings.

|I live in the Lower Peninsula part of Virginia where the microclimate constantly screws with my Rachio irrigation controller’s weather intelligence. It’s not uncommon for it to be raining heavily a quarter mile from away while it’s sunny here or vice versa. This year the Rachio’s weather intelligence “saw” significantly more observed rainfall than actual and ended up skipping a large number of scheduled watering days. This combined with frequent temps over 90 degrees made for an extra crispy late summer lawn. I split my time between VA and MA so it’s not all that easy to tell if the lawn is getting the right amount of water when I’m away. By the time I got back a couple of weeks ago the lawn was in pretty tough shape. I’ve had my eye on the Tempest for a while now and the recent direct integration with the Rachio made it a no-brainer decision. The integration seemed simple enough (select “Add Device” in the Rachio app, select “Tempest” and enter a 6 digit integration code) but a number of Amazon reviewers complained that it was difficult/impossible to get the code from WeatherFlow or Rachio and WeatherFlow’s on-line community also had a number of posts complaining about the process.|1.

We haven't checked wind speed or humidity. But at this point it would be a miracle if they are even close.Technical support is non-existent. We supplied the detailed rain data.

|We own a ranch in the Texas hill country and needed a way to keep our animals and gear safe from adverse weather so we bought the Tempest in Oct 2023 because of the positive reviews. Right away I could tell the rain and wind accuracy were way off based on other stations and the weather around us. BTW, the station is mounted 50 yards from any obstruction and has full sun.
Contacted the manufacturer and they rebooted the system and said everything was better. Regularly me and my neighbor who also has a Tempest will have standing water showing no to little rain as well as having 50 mph wind gusts that only showed mid twenties. Temperature seems close but a bit higher than ambient as it will show a low temp of 35 degrees but the bird baths will have frozen solid.VERY disappointed spending 300+ for a station that performs so poorly. Sadly I was the manufacturer was adamant that the station would be accurate give it time so I didn't follow my gut and send it back.I will keep y'all informed if I am able to figure out a way to get this even close to accurate.

|I have this weather station in operation for 18 months more or less is a very cool but completely unreliable This last summer thunderstorm was the straw that broke the camels back. As I watched the accumulative rainfall - not the rate of rainfall - drift backwards from more that 2" to less than 1" until the rain stopped then rise again to 1.2" after it stopped. I just got so tired of its failed potential that I though I'd do something I hardly ever do and write a review. I was trained as a weather specialist in the Air Force and have always loved having my own weather equipment because it's fun to see the weather conditions right outside compared the area picture shown in weather apps like WeatherBug or AccuWeather. But this "weather station" is a joke! Over and over again, I have observed the accumulative rain show one amount and then a lesser accumulative rainfall later even thought it has been raining continuously. How does it "unrain"?
Same thing with windspeed. I have seen the wind blowing so hard that rain and hail are traveling horizontally through the air, tree limbs will be crashing down and the wind speed, according to this Weather Station" will show as 5 mph with gusts to 10. That's an afternoon breeze not the wind blast from a Texas thunderstorm. I wish this worked, because the set up is easy, the equipment seems durable, it has a number of useful functions and if it was accurate it would be a lot of fun, but an unreliable weather station is about as handy as a broken watch.|1.

|This unit replaces a ten+ year old Oregon Scientific station that over the last five years had steadily decayed. This HP2564 is far better in every respect. The package came with the WS90 all-in-one sensor ultrasonic anemometer/vane, piezoelectric rain gauge, light and UV sensor and thermo-hygrometer; the HP2560_C color display; a ring of bird deterrence spikes; and two paper manuals. The all-in-one sensor is compact and easy to set up. I installed two AA lithium backup batteries. I have it mounted on a PVC pole. I did not opt for the A/C heater module. I can't swear by the rain gauge, but it seems close to nearby station rainfall readings. The display is bright (brightness is adjustable) and easy to read. My unit is about 50 feet and two walls away from the sensor with all-bars on the WIFI icon lit up. It also comes with an interior thermometer and hygrometer, and micro-SD port, 32GB max FAT. The micro-SD card continually outputs readings in CSV format which are easy to analyze in Excel or similar spreadsheets and the card will take a long time to fill up. There is no battery backup (although the micro-SD card could be considered an approximation of same), so get a small UPS for the AC input if that's an issue. It's a little wonky to initialize, although the paper manual is adequate and online resources a little better.

This isn't the end of the world; once it is set up it is set up. But it is kind of cheesy.Finally, I have doubts about the haptic rain gauge. It has been bone dry since I bought it so I don't have empirical data to share. I'll compare it with an old fashioned accumulator and I'll let you know. The good news is that Ecowitt offers a tipping bucket rain gauge as an add-on. Other commenters have b*tched about its accuracy in heavy downpours but this is a homeowner system.

|I was looking forward to replacing my old Acurite 5 in 1 Weather Station with this new EcoWitt HP2564 providing all of the same features without moving parts and the need to replace batteries. The monitor and smartphone app met my expectations for measurement display but the weather station (WS90) left me in a quandary. The system came with two firmware versions out of date. I was able to update the firmware in the monitor (HP2560_C) but the WS90 was another story. First, the firmware updates can only be processed on a Windows 7 or higher machine. (Found out from Customer Support) I have an Apple Mac. After borrowing a Windows Computer from a friend I tried several times to load the new firmware to the WS90 without success. Customer Service is clearly from another country as the ReadMe file instructions and email responses for assistance are all in secondhand English and not very helpful. When you spend $300 for a weather station you are the type of person that plans to keep the firmware up to date and the WS90 is not User Friendly for firmware updates.
