| This ammonia gas detector can accurately detect gas/ammonia while also keeping track of the temperature (both C/F) and humidity. It has a tripod mount port so you can mount it and have it continually monitor things to get an accurate reading of change in the same spot. The case could be better, but it gets the job done and the detector works great. | 1. Accurate gas detection - Explicit 2. Stable and continuous monitoring via tripod mount - Explicit 3. Environmental monitoring of the humidity and temperature - Explicit |
| This is a good gas detector. Seems to be working correctly. Not hard to use. Seems to give me good readings. The case is made out of a hard plastic and is wrapped with a shock absorber hard rubberized type material to protect it against drops. I still would take precautions against doing so. Seems to be well made. Does come with directions for use. I do like how the detector comes with a temperature and humidity screen. The only complaint I have about this is the case. I mean for a quality detector there should be a quality case to put it in. Come on now. For something of this value it should be finished off with a great case. If it wasn’t for that I would give this 5 stars. | 1. Durable and protective case - Latent 2. User-friendly operation - Explicit 3. Enhanced aesthetics for quality perception - Explicit | 
| This meter works well and has the same ammonia reading as the five gas meter we were using. The readout is hard to see in bright sunlight but is great inside silos. | 1. Readout visibility in varying lighting conditions - Latent 2. Effective usage in specific environments - Explicit 3. Accurate ammonia reading - Explicit |

| This is my third AcuRite station I've bought over the past 10 years, only because of weather related issues with the outside units. My last one two weeks ago was struck by baseball sized hail that broke off one of my wind scoops. Luckily, even with the new outside unit, my other previous inside monitors still pick it up, so now I have three monitors of all sorts in my house. I do like the color monitor with this new unit. I'm not sure why people say they can't read theirs from different angles because I plugged mine in and can read it perfectly from all angles. It also looks good and is easier to read when the room is dark. | 1. Weather station durability - Latent 2. Color display preference - Latent 3. Variable display angle visibility - Latent |
| Had a minimal sensor AcuRite and placed the outside sensor in the shade but weather is such a big thing in Tucson I added an upgrade and the sensor is in the sun with a wind speed. Set up was EASY and put both on channel C added batteries and it worked Using to compare to the other the inside is very close and the in sun temps is up a few degrees. I LOVE the black background- the other lite up the roommate night but that's OK both are cool the combo is priced right, good quality and accurate so far-plus easy to set up | 1. Weather station placement flexibility - Explicit 2. Ease of setup - Explicit 3. Affordability - Explicit |
| I had other weather stations that only showed the dew point until you reached certain temps, then it switched to heat index or wind chill, this one will show it all the time if you want. I love the extra features over some others I've had before like seeing not only the day high and low, but also the months high/low and all time high/low. I had a receiver for an older model Acurite 3 in 1, and it works off of the sensor as well, so anyone who is wondering if you can use more than one receiver for this, it's possible. Now I keep my older one upstairs in my bedroom and this main one in the kitchen. The screen is very bright with adjustable brightness, very easy to read. | 1. Adjustable brightness for display - Explicit 2. Compatibility with older models - Explicit 3. Comprehensive historical data - Explicit |

| Already broke | Explicit - Durable |
| The display readability is poor, requiring a very specific viewing angle for things to appear bright. The buttons on this are terrible, (loose, occasionally unresponsive, just cheap in general) Accuracy: Didn't experience any. With both units within 3 feet of each other, I received the following readings Temperature: Indoor = 188 F, Outdoor = 75 F (within 30 minutes, Indoor reading was 32 F) Humidity: Indoor = 88%, Outdoor = 41% (within 30 minutes indoor reading was blank) Time: Time and date were set, but within 20 minutes, the time was slow by 7 minutes. I went through the calibration procedure, but it would not allow calibration of the indoor sensors, and routinely failed to advance from measure to measure with button presses. In general, the behavior seemed like there were firmware bugs or poor connections. I'd say quality control and construction materials should be reviewed. | 1. Display readability - Explicit 2. Accuracy of readings - Explicit 3. Button quality and responsiveness - Explicit |
| Not very good. Wind speed sensor reads low. The weather forecasting feature is wrong more often than not. The display is too bright and the history is annoying as it continually flips from one sensor to another. If I could return this I would but have had for over a month so can't. | 1. Accurate wind speed sensor - Explicit 2. Return policy - Latent |

## Jamboard

Once the needs were thoroughly understood and weighted, the team proceeded to convert them into precise specifications. This involved translating user needs into functional requirements. For example, if users emphasized the need for accurate temperature readings, a specification was developed: "Temperature sensor with an accuracy of ±1°C." Design considerations were also incorporated into these specifications, addressing how each need would be met. For instance, if durability was a crucial requirement, specifications included details about materials and construction methods ensuring the product's longevity.

To assign appropriate weights to each need, our team employed an approach that prioritizes needs which surfaced more frequently in user interviews and were assigned higher weights. For instance, if product reliability was a common concern mentioned by 80% of users, it received a correspondingly higher weight. Additionally, qualitative data was considered to fine-tune these weights. If a particular need was strongly emphasized by users, it was granted a higher weight, even if it wasn't the most frequently mentioned.

In summary, our weather station project originated from a thorough analysis of user reviews on Amazon, helping us identify crucial user needs. Through team discussions, we translated these needs into detailed engineering specifications, considering both active and passive requirements. The importance assigned to each specification was based on user feedback and internal evaluations. Our design assessment strategy includes rigorous functional, usability, and reliability testing, aiming to not just meet but exceed user expectations.
