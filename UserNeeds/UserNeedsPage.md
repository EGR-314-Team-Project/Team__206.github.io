# User Needs, Benchmarking, and Requirements
In the initial phase, our team conducted extensive research by analyzing user comments on various online platforms related to existing weather stations. By delving into forums, product reviews, and community discussions, we gained valuable insights into the experiences, preferences, and challenges users faced with current weather stations. These online user comments were systematically organized, and recurring themes were identified. This meticulous organization allowed us to distill common needs and concerns expressed by users.

The collected data was then meticulously organized by identifying common themes and patterns in the user feedback. Needs were categorized into distinct groups such as functionality, usability, durability, and connectivity. To ensure a targeted approach, the team prioritized these needs based on their perceived significance to users and alignment with the overarching project goals.


## Voice of the Customers Benchmarking
The process of deriving user needs was conducted by extensively researching user comments on related products available online, particularly focusing on customer reviews on platforms like Amazon. The team meticulously analyzed the feedback and opinions shared by users who had hands-on experience with similar weather stations. By extracting valuable insights from these reviews, the team identified recurring themes and specific requirements voiced by the users. The focus on existing product reviews ensured that the derived user needs were rooted in real-world user experiences and expectations, enhancing the relevance and authenticity of the specified requirements for the envisioned weather station concept. This data-driven approach from actual users on e-commerce platforms played a pivotal role in shaping the foundational aspects of the product design.
