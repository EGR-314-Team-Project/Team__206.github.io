Team Organization

Team Charter: 	To create a groundbreaking product that showcases a significant advancement in complexity compared to the previous EGR 304 project. This project aims to proficiently leverage our expertise in PCB design, utilizing the industry-standard tool, Cadence, to enhance our competence in this domain. Additionally, the project aims to strengthen practical skills in Computer-Aided Design (CAD) and Programming, fostering continual growth in these crucial areas.

Product Mission Statement: To create a mobile weather station that captures precise sensory data and translates it into actionable outputs, addressing defined tasks with innovation and collaborative efficiency.To create a mobile weather station that captures precise sensory data and translates it into actionable outputs, addressing defined tasks with innovation and collaborative efficiency

As our team has more experience now, we wanted to increase the complexity of our current project and further push boundaries. This sentiment is reflected in our team Charter which seeks to focus on things our members are good at by pointing out specific areas where we want to apply our skills. 

For our mission statement, we wanted to keep it aligned as much as possible with the core requirements for our project. However, we wanted to ensure we still allowed room for creativity and focused on making the final product run as efficiently as possible -rather than simple functioning and meeting the basic requirements.
